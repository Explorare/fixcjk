# FixCJK!
_Fix CJK fonts for Chrome and Firefox_

This was orignally developed to workaround the [chromium bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=448478). However now one can use this userscript to fix and change CJK fonts as well as Latin fonts. This is especially usefull for Linux users where the system font fallback list might be very confusing (Sometime you can hardly predict what is the actual font for Sans or Serif in Chrome/Chromium/Firfox!) and common web fonts assigned in the CSS list are often missing.

## Usage
Currently, just change variabl definations from **CJKdefault** to **FixPunct**.
